**Overview**\n
This project was developed as part of a 48-hour hackathon for Waverly LLC, a wealth management company. Our team of five members collaborated to create descriptive analytics for various client portfolios with the goal of uncovering patterns related to gain/loss, average return, ACWI/AGG ratio, and holding type. All data used in this project has been encrypted to ensure maximum security and confidentiality.
\n\n
**Objectives**\n
Analyze client portfolios to identify patterns and insights.
Develop a clustering predictive model to identify outliers in the data.
Assist Waverly LLC in understanding potential risks and opportunities within client portfolios.
\n\n
**Data Security** \n
To maintain the highest level of data security, all client data used in this project has been encrypted.
\n\n
**Analytics and Insights**\n
\n\n
__Descriptive Analytics__\n
We conducted descriptive analytics to understand the following metrics for client portfolios:
\n\n
Gain/Loss
Average Return
ACWI/AGG Ratio
Holding Type
\n\n
__Clustering Predictive Model__\n
After identifying patterns in the data, we developed a clustering predictive model to categorize clients and highlight outliers. This model helps Waverly LLC to:
\n\n
Identify anomalies in client portfolios.
Investigate the characteristics that make an account an outlier.
Learn from clients with high gains to potentially mitigate risks for clients at risk of loss.
\n\n
__Additional Metric: Top Performing Company Representative__\n
As an additional metric, we analyzed which company representative managed the highest value clients. This insight can help Waverly LLC to recognize top-performing representatives and possibly learn from their strategies to improve overall client management.
\n\n
**Presentation**\n
We presented our findings and predictive model to Waverly LLC during a formal presentation, showcasing our methodology, insights, and recommendations.
\n\n
**Future Work**\n
Continuously update the predictive model with new data for improved accuracy.
Explore additional metrics and factors that may influence client portfolios.
Collaborate with Waverly LLC to implement our recommendations and monitor results.
\n\n
**Conclusion**\n
Our project aims to provide Waverly LLC with valuable insights into client portfolios, helping them to better understand their clients' needs, identify potential risks, and optimize their wealth management strategies. We believe that our analytics and predictive model can contribute to Waverly LLC's success in delivering exceptional service to their clients.
